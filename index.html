Most of the things he said were right but the timing was wrong! There’s a renovation plan already in place and there’s a new person in charge. Glazers have not been great in handling the club though. This outburst will make them work harder but Ronaldo will be the scapegoat even though he has nothing to lose considering he has gotten all that can be in football. It’s just it’s better not to slam the door when leaving bcos u might just need to pass through the same route again. SAF is like a father to him, he would have spoken to him rather than Piers Morgan. That guy is always controversial and would be the one to benefit more from this saga.

You may not like CR7 but the club should not have hijacked his move to mancity if this is how he will be treated? There are worst players on that squad but we're never targeted. Give him a break. Even if CR7 leave the team will still play rubbish. The coach should work on getting result rather than picking on CR7.
